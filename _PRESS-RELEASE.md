There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

  > A utility to help developers sort through the cacophony of available NPM libraries and find the right tools for the job.

## Summary ##
  > **m o d u l o** analyses npm modules to find the most up-to-date, stable, and widely-used libraries to fit the user's needs. Module quality metrics are exposed to the user immediately upon searching, and advanced statistics are visualized for in-depth comparisons.

## Problem ##
  > There are too damn many npm modules with no way to objectively compare the quality of available tools to fit the desired task.

## Solution ##
  > **m o d u l o** makes intelligent use of data available in the NPM regstry to present meaningful comparisons to the user, allowing developers to make informed decisions regarding library usage.

## Quote from You ##
  > "I can't believe this didn't exist before!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply search by module name or desired tool keyword. The comparisons are made and presented immediately upon loading.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
